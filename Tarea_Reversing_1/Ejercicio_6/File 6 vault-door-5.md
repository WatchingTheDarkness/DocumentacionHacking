# 6 - vault-door-5

## Descripcion:
* In the last challenge, you mastered octal (base 8), decimal (base 10), and hexadecimal (base 16) numbers, but this vault door uses a different change of base as well as URL encoding!
The source code for this vault is here: VaultDoor5.java
* You may find an encoder/decoder tool helpful, such as https://encoding.tools/
* Read the wikipedia articles on URL encoding and base 64 encoding to understand how they work and what the results look like.
